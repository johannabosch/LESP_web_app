           Survival and productivity rates were modeled based on capture-mark-recapture methods for breeding adults across all six colonies, with survival constrained to the logit of the estimated survival rates and associated sampling error. Productivity was modeled as a binomial, with random effects applied in years lacking data. Transition probabilities for immature, pre-breeding, and breeding stages were based on survival and age-specific breeding propensity. To read more about the model parameters, visit the <a href="/model-schematic">model schematic</a> page. <br /><br /> <strong>RESULTS:</strong> Modeled productivity generally tracked observed values, with differences between colonies, especially higher productivity in Newfoundland compared to Maritime colonies. Survival estimates for younger cohorts varied, with Baccalieu and Kent Islands showing lower post-fledge juvenile survival. Transition probabilities remained uncertain but did not notably affect overall model behavior. For more detailed results, refer to the <a href="/manuscript">full manuscript</a>.
